# Flask-Internship-Project
A Simple Flask Blog Website i made during my mandatory 3 Week School Internship

DO NOT USE THIS IN AN PRODUCTION ENVIROMENT. It is not Production ready and never will be.

I wrote this to Learn the Basics of Python and Flask so there will be a lot of bad Security Practices.

Install the Dependencies using ```pip install requirements.txt``` and run with ```flask --run blog```
